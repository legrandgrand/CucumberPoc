This POC aims at presenting how to use cucumber on a JS front-end, either in standalone or with cypress.

Two libraries are used here:
* @cucumber/cucumber: https://cucumber.io/
* cypress with cucumber processor: https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor

To run tests:
* standalone tests: npm run test
* cypress tests: npm run test:cypress
